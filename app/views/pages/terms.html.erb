IPDB MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE IPDB SERVICES OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE IPDB SERVICES.

<h4>IPDb Software Terms </h4>
<p>In addition to these Conditions of Use, the terms found here apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with IPDb Services (“IPDb Software”). If we provide specific Terms for the IPDb Software and there is a conflict between the specific Terms for the IPDb Software and these Conditions of Use, the specific Terms for the IPDb Software will govern.</p>

<h4>Applicable Law</h4>
<p>By using any IPDb Service, you agree that the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and IPDb.</p>

<h4>Disputes</h4>
<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any IPDb Service, or any products or services sold or distributed by IPDb or through the IPDb Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>

<p>a. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>
<p>b. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent IPDb, 15705 Arrow Hwy #2, Irwindale, CA 91706. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, IPDb will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. 
</p>
<p>c. You and IPDb each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and IPDb each waive any right to a jury trial. You and IPDb also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>Please review our other policies. These policies also govern your use of IPDb Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these our site, policies, Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
